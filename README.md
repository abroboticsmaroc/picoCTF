picoCTF challenges writeups

Hi,

I will put here all the challenges I solved with all bash and python scripts I created to solve them.
For almost all the challenges I solved I made scripts that automatically solve them. you just have to change servers ports to the ones you will find in pico CTF web site when you want to solve them.

for any question or if you want to join my team in pico CTF or for other ctf ,please send me message to: abroboticsmaroc@gmail.com
